Short answer:
I wrote some Scala code to give me an algorithm. It starts by dropping the cat from the 21st floor....

Long answer:

The first question to ask is "what makes a good experiment?"  It helps to answer this with counterfactuals: what is a bad experiment?

An experiment is useless if it doesn't give you any new information.  If you know, before hand, that your experiment will pass or fail, then there's no point in doing it.

Starting with the equation
p(x)=x**3-300*x**2+a*x+b
and knowing that it has 3 positive integer roots, we can write it out as:
p(x)=(x-x1)(x-x2)(x-x3)

Expanding that out gives
p(x)=x^3-(x1+x2+x3)x^2 - (x1x3+x2*x3+x1x2)x - x1x2x3

so 300=x1+x2+x3
and since x1,x2,x3>=1
x1,x2,x3<=298

There is no reason to assume that they are distinct, so (100,100,100) is possible, as is (99,99,102) etc.

Without loss of generality we can order the 3 roots as x1<=x2<=x3, where
1 <= x1 <= 100,
x1 <= x2 <= (300-x1)/2, and
x3 = 300-x1-x2.

One can do a double integral over x1,x2 (or draw a triangle) to find out there are 7500 unique cases.  The problem, essentially, is to distinguish between all these cases.

Perhaps there's some mathematical shortcut, like using the parity of the hamming weights of the binary representation xor-ed with the results of the previous test to determine the next test or something???  It almost looks like Binary Space Partitioning, and getting lost on wikipedia made me consider the Ternary numeral system, but I saw no obvious mathematical solution, so falling back to computer programming...

Translating this into computer science terms:

We need to form a binary tree with max depth of 16 (where the root node has depth 0) and any path has at most 7 left nodes.  The root node will contain all 7500 cases, and will partition that set according to the predicate p(n)>=0.  What is n for every node?  Left nodes will have only 1 case.

val allCandidates = for {
 x1<- 1 to 100
 x2 <- x1 to (300-x1)/2 }
 yield (x1,x2,300-x1-x2)

(1,1,298), (1,2,297), (1,3,296),...

allCandidates.length == 7500

How can we generate a tree with these constraints?

How about we use induction.

If we have run out of cats, or have run out of experiments, we better have only 1 case left.
Otherwise, we will run this experiment and it will pass or fail, leading us closer to our base case.  Normally we would like a nicely balanced binary tree and we get that by a roughly even split between pass and fail.  But now since there's a penalty for failure, we should slightly bias our results to pass.  Of course if all our tests pass, then we won't be any better off and we might as well have not run the experiment at all.  An upper bound for the capabilities at this level is the sum of the capabilities of the pass and fail cases.

def maxDistinguishableCases(d: Int, lefts: Int): Int = (d, lefts) match {
    case (d, lefts) if (lefts == 0) => 1
    case (d, lefts) if (d == MAXEXPERIMENTS) => 1
    case _ => maxDistinguishableCases(d + 1, lefts - 1) + maxDistinguishableCases(d + 1, lefts)
 } 


We can even use this heuristic to guide our split at this level.  We should choose n such that the pass:fail ratio roughly matches their respective capabilities.
This feels similar to the August 2014 Ponder This where there was a preference to choosing the right node vs the left.

It was at this point where I though of something like a genetic algorithm to identify the best assignment of n to each node, but it would be tricky to breed trees with different topologies.

Instead we could attack it head on and just vary n to try to split the number of cases, biased according to our heuristic.  I plotted the results of the number of failed cases vs n.  It started near 0 at 0, increased to a local maximum just over half near n=50, decreased to around 10% at n=128 (2^7??), before increasing up to 100% by 300 as expected, except with a negative second derivative. It reaches a second local maximum at 300. It is not a cubic equation, but it has 3 regions where it crosses the "ideal" ratio.

def outputIfSolvable(xs: IndexedSeq[(Int, Int, Int)], experimentNumber: Int, catsLeft: Int, printB: Boolean, history: Vector[(Int,Boolean)] = Vector()): Boolean =
    {

      if (experimentNumber <= MAXEXPERIMENTS && catsLeft > 0) {

val idealRatio = 1.0 * maxNodes(experimentNumber + 1, catsLeft - 1) / maxNodes(experimentNumber, catsLeft)
(1 to 300) sortBy (n => {
          val failedNodes = candidates filter p(n)
          val ratioError = failedNodes.size.toDouble / candidates.size - idealRatio
          Math.abs(ratioError)
        })

This will put the most promissing candidates first.

/* find needs to follow after }) or else it won't compile */
         find (k =>
          {
            val (failedCandidates,passedCandidates) = candidates partition p(k)
            (
              failedCandidates.size > 0 &&
              passedCandidates.size > 0 &&
              failedCandidates.size <= maxNodesLeft &&
              passedCandidates.size <= maxNodesRight &&

We simply recurse.  k will be a solution if and only if the child nodes are also solutions.

              outputIfSolvable(failedCandidates, experimentNumber + 1, catsLeft - 1, false) &&
              outputIfSolvable(passedCandidates, experimentNumber + 1, catsLeft, false))
          }) match {

We were either able to solve the problem, or we weren't. k, as on Option will either be Some(k) or None.
If we were successful in finding a solution, find the solution again and pass it the nodes and results along its path.  Print all the leaf nodes.
          case Some(k) =>
            {
              if (printB) {
                println(experimentNumber, catsLeft, k)
                val (failedCandidates,passedCandidates) = candidates partition p(k)
                outputIfSolvable(failedCandidates, experimentNumber + 1, catsLeft - 1, true, history :+ (k,false))
                outputIfSolvable(passedCandidates, experimentNumber + 1, catsLeft,     true, history :+ (k,true))
              }
              true
            }
          case None => false
        }

      }
      else false
    }        
	  
Success occurs when
     if (candidates.size == 1) { // We have a unique solution, no more need for further experiments.
        if (printB) {
          println("After " + (experimentNumber - 1) + " experiments with " + catsLeft +
          " cats left, we conclude that the roots are " + candidates.head + "\nThe path we took to get here is")
          history.foreach(println(_))
        }
      true

And failure occurs when we run out of experiments or cats!

This recursive algorithm runs sufficiently fast to solve slightly harder versions.  I found that we can solve this with 15 experiments and 7 cats!
But it is impossible with 14 experiments and 7 cats!
It is also impossible with 15 experiments and 6 cats!
But it is possible with 16 experiments and 6 cats!
But it is impossible with 16 experiments and 5 cats!

So reducing the number of cats from 7 to 6 would probably be a bigger savings to the company than reducing the number of experiments from 16 to 15.
It is also impossible with 17 experiments and 5 cats.
But it is possible with 18 experiments and 5 cats!

The output starts like this: (With 15 experiments and 7 cats)
(1,6,21)
(2,5,106)
(3,4,5)
(4,3,140)

....

The entire output can be used to create your series of cat dropping experiments. Start with n=21, fails, try n=106, if it passes search for (21,true). Repeat until a leaf node is reached.

I had some fun overlaying a series of 7500 plots in Octave, and animated them in a gif to illustrate an example case.

Thanks for another fun puzzle,

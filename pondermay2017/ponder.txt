Almost had this super early without making a program brute force it.

You can build a pyramid of the, using just odd numbers spanning a single gap

  1 1
 31 13
531 135
etc.

The even numbers can span two gaps
  2  2
 42  24
642  246
...

Now the part I was missing was how to deal with 3 gaps. I didn't think of the "two birds with one stone approach" until way later. I thought you needed to solve each independantly, like the odds something like (up to 9 for example)

975315135795
of course this gives a problem with the 5s now, so maybe use an even number
97 31213279
And get rid of that pesky 5 with a new gap. Thought that you could repeat this until the gap goes away, maybe involving fibonacci numbers or something.

Turns out it's almost obvious to plug the odds and even sets side by side, and use the largest number to plug the odds gap with one of the evens gap

531 135642  246
5317135642 7246

No problem scaling this up to any N.

The program I wrote was a fun little random algorithm, found solutions up to N=17 or so.

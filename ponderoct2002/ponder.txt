Hi, I believe I got the answer to the October 2002 Ponder This challenge.
 
I went about it by first doing some trial games by hand.  All games with
N<=6.
 
I noticed that all people 1:M have equal probability of being picked last,
and that probability is the first part of e1 in my pdf file.
 
The remaining M+1 .. N players I derived their probabilities, first in
terms of a summation of powers, then simplified using a formula that turns
the summations into closed form expressions.
 
I provided a matlab file that calculates it two different ways.  The
first, the brute force, matches my hand calculations.  The elegent way
matches the brute force way for every M and N value I tried.
 
Please let me know one way or the other.
 
Thank you very much.  I really enjoy these challenges and this is the
first I got before the deadline.

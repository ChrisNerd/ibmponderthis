I believe I have the solution to November's ponder this.

Part 1, The number 29 is the largest integer that can't be formed with 1, 2, 3 and 4.

Part 2. There are numerous instances that form all the intergers up to 29.  Some of these include:
octave> ponder
inlist =

  1  2  3  9

k = 31
inlist =

   1   2   3  10

k = 34
inlist =

  1  2  4  5

k = 33
inlist =

  1  2  4  7

k = 38
inlist =

  1  2  4  9

k = 41
inlist =

   1   2   4  10

k = 35
inlist =

  1  2  5  6

k = 44
inlist =

  1  2  5  8

k = 44
inlist =

  1  2  5  9

k = 31
inlist =

   1   2   5  10

k = 34
inlist =

  1  2  6  9

k = 34
inlist =

  2  3  4  5

k = 32
inlist =

  2  3  4  7

k = 36
inlist =

  2  3  4  9

k = 34
inlist =

  2  3  5  6

k = 33
....

The best sets I found were 1, 2, 5, 6 and 1, 2, 5, 8 which got up to (and excluding) 44.

I pretty much brute forced this problem, by hard coding each combination into an octave script.  The functions nchoosek(1:16,4) and perms(inlist) came in handy in creating all the candidate a,b,c,d sets.

I've attached my source files.  They can be run in matlab or octave by running the command ponder


Thanks for this challenge

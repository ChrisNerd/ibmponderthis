Short answer:
p ~~ 94668920 / 189373729

Long answer:
My first instinct was to use continued fractions, since they have the desired property of giving the best rational approximation.

If p is the probability of heads, let q =1-p = the probability of tails.
The probability that the computer wins is
 (1-q)*(1+q^13+q^14+q^18+q^19+q^22)=1/2

This polynomial of degree 23 apparently can be solved in continued fraction form directly, but I'm uncertain how.

Putting this into wolframalpha gives me an arbitrary precision decimal solution to p=1-q.
p=0.499905242928389504529621945225162859221090463453651027277789301914...

Another possible way of solving this would be to use Newton's method.

I wrote a very simple C++ program to loop through the denominators d from 1 to 10^9, and found that 14 matched the double float precision of p exactly at the precision of doubles.  I therefore utilized the arbitrary precision library gmp and found the best approximation is
94668920 / 189373729

Later, I went back to the continued fraction idea, and in wolframalpha I converted the decimal form to continued fraction, truncated it to a finite number of terms, then converted that to a rational.  I found that with 19 terms it gave a rational approximation with 9 digits in the denominator, and it matched the solution I found with my program.  Using 20 terms of the continued fraction resulted in a denominator with 10 digits.

fromcontinuedfraction[continuedfraction[0.499905242928389504529621945225162859221090463453651027277789301914,19]]
results in
94668920 / 189373729, the same answer as before.

As for the significance fo the 6 positions choosen, I thought it might have something to do with the corresponding letters
1 a
14 n
15 o
19 s
20 t
23 w
but don't see any anagrams to make from it.  Perhaps these 6 positions give a very difficult to approximate root.

Thanks for the interesting problem.

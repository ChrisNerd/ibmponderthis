I actually solved this years ago with a visual basic program.
(see http://localhost/math.htm or whatever my ip is now
Largest circle in a cube
Unfortunately I don't seem to have that code any more.)


The length of a side of the square has length root(9/8).

The vertices of the square are 1/4 units away from the cube's vertices, and along the cubes edges.

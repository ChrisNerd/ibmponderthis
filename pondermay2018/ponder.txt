We have 11 coins, and exactly two of them are counterfeit with slightly smaller weights than the others. Find the two fake coins using just four weighings of a double-pan balance scale.

Supply your answer as four lines of dash-separated lists of the letters A-K corresponding to the coins.

As an example, here is a solution for the case of seven coins:
ADE-BCG
AG-BE
AC-DG


****

So for each 11 choose 2 = 55 combinations, we need a unique output set
7 choose 2 = 21.

Say AB is one case we get
0
0
-1.
AC gives
0
-1
-2, does double pan read -1??

So how many different experiments can we run anyway?
Makes sense to only balance equal numbers, so 1 vs 1, up to 5 vs 5.
So 11 choose i, gives you one side, then there are 11-i remaining, of which you have to choose another i, so (11-i) choose i.
But this will double count exactly, since you can pick set A on the left and B on the right, and then again A and B reversed sides.
We can filter out half of them by, say, finding the lowest coin amongst both sets and only allowing it to be on the left.

So if the lowest coin is on the left, we can choose 4 from 11, then find the lowest amounst those 4 then drop everything below that from the remaining 7.

So 1/2 * sum from i=1 to 5 of 11 choose i * (11-i)choose i

12826.

That's not bad.

Now our solution will be a set of 4 of those experiments.
12826 choose 4 = 1.12706903782935 Ã— 10^15
Yikes. Possible I guess. 1 Quadrillion.

Hmmm, maybe there's no point in doing 1 vs 1 experiments.

There's also no point in selecting a set 4 experiments that don't "cover" all 11 coins? Or 9 coins?

So 1/2 * sum from i=**2** to 5 of 11 choose i * (11-i)choose i
Haha, 12771

Maybe the 5 vs 5 won't do much good either?



1/2 * sum from i=2 to 4 of ((11 choose i) * ((11-i) choose i))
= 11385

11385 choose 4 = 7 X 10^14... Maybe we should just go for it.

Maybe, without loss of generality we can start with ABCD vs EFGH,
then the other 3 tests shouldn't include an exact duplicate of any set before it?
ABCD vs EFGH
That's only 1 out of the 12826 possibilities, so we now have to select another 3 from the 12825, so 12825 choose 3 = 3X10^11,.. better! That seems doable.

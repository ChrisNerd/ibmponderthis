The total length of fence is 2.63895...

The configuration is illustrated in the attached png image.

A Steiner tree would meet the requirements.  Each corner of the square
needs to be a vertex, i.e. the fence must go to each corner.

I watched the video on Steiner trees at:

A key point in helping find the steiner vertex was that it had to make 3 -
120 degree angles.

We can get a bit better than a fully connected Steiner tree.  We connect 3
corners in a Steiner tree, and for the fourth corner, run the fence to the
centre of the square.  This involves only creating ( N-2 = ) one Steiner
vertex.  Its position was found by calculating the total fence length
f(a) = 2*sqrt((1-a/sqrt(2))^2 + (a/sqrt(2))^2) + a;
where a is the length of the top right fence (going 45 degrees).
setting df/da = 0 gets me the position, (with a = .2998858... I know
there's a simple exact representation).  Adding the sqrt(2)/2 for the
fourth fence gave me a total fence length of 2.63895...

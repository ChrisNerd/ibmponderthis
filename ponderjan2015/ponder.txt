Short answer:
3 A1 A2
7 B1 B2
6 A1 B1
4 A2 B2

A 2x2 board would suffice.
  6 4
3 a b
7 c d
solves uniquely to 

  6 4
3 2 1
7 4 3

The 3 must be composed of 2+1, and the 4 must be composed of 3+1.  The 1 in commom must be at the intersection.  Therefore the solution is unique.


But remove any two clues would lead to 1 of 3 cases
1) Both clues are removed from the columns	 
  b b
3 2 1
7 5 2, 4 3
leading to arbrary solutions for the second row as well as the arbitrary order of the first row.


2) Both clues are removed from the rows
  6 4
b 4 3
b 2 1

  6 4
b 1 3
b 5 1

3) One clue is removed from a row, one from a column.  There are 4 instances.  The cell at the intersection of the removed clue could be anything.
  b 4
3 2 1
b x 3

  6 b
3 1 2
b 5 x

  b 4
b x 1
7 4 3


  6 b
b 2 x
7 4 3

In each case x can be anything not already used.



3 = 2 1
4 = 3 1

6 = 5 1, 4 2
7 = 6 1, 5 2, 4 3

  6 b
3 1 2
b 5 x

x can be anything

  b 4
3 2 1
b x 3

  b b
3 2 1
7 5 2, 4 3

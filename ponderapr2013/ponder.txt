PONDER.THIS == 625097.1438

My solution wasn't too fancy.  Just an easily coded brute force octave script with 10 embedded for loops.  Ran surprisingly fast, normally brute force solutions aren't successful for ponder this-es.

I wasn't sure if using 0 was permitted, but it must be if we use 10 distinct digits.

Thanks for the easy problem.  March was too hard for me.  My simulated annealing attempt was down the wrong track.

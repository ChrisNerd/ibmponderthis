ANSWER:
XXXXXX XXXX == PONDER THIS

SOLUTION:
I started by plugging the equation into Wolfram Alpha
Wolfram alpha
204193/178481 + 2**-40 in base 8
1.11160440223415004470220111604402234110044702201116044022341100447022011160440223411004470220111604402234110044702201116044022341100447022011160440223411004470220111604402234110044702201116044022341100447022011160440223411004470220111604402234110044702201116044022341100447022011160440223411004470220111604402234110044702201116044022341100447022011160440223411004470220111604402234110044702201116044022341100447022011160440223411004470220111604402234110044702201116044022341100447022011160440223411004470220111..._8
I pasted the base 8 number into emacs and adjusted the window's width to determine the number's period.  The number 1 appears at the following positions after the point
1,2,3,13,
24,25,26,36,37,
47,48,49,59,60,
...

Since this puzzle reminded me of the game of Nin, I started reading there, and came across this varient called Substract a Square.  It has a solution that I was able to make a simple modification to do solve this problem.

The numbers above are the "cold" numbers.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtract_a_square
1) the number 0 is 'cold'.

2) if all numbers 0 .. N-1 have been classified as either 'hot' or 'cold', then
  2a) the number N is 'cold' if only 'hot' numbers can be reached by subtracting a positive square
  2b) the number N is 'hot' if at least one 'cold' number can be reached by subtracting a positive square

Here I made a guess.  The first game being "IBM RULES", I guessed that the second game was "PONDER THIS" which correspond to the numbers
XXXXXX XXXX == PONDER THIS
16-15-14-4-5-18 20-8-9-19

in order:
4-5-8-9-14-15-16-18-19-20

Modifying the algorithm of Substract A Square to subtract the numbers of this set verified the sets of cold and hot numbers.

0 is cold,
1,2,3 are cold

 26-8=18 which is hot.
 26-5=21 which is hot.
 26-4=22 which is hot.
27 is hot because 27-14=13 which is cold.
28 is hot because 28-4=24 which is cold.
29 is hot because 29-4=25 which is cold.
30 is hot because 30-4=26 which is cold.
31 is hot because 31-5=26 which is cold.
32 is hot because 32-8=24 which is cold.
33 is hot because 33-8=25 which is cold.
34 is hot because 34-8=26 which is cold.
35 is hot because 35-9=26 which is cold.

 37-9=28 which is hot.
 37-8=29 which is hot.
 37-5=32 which is hot.
 37-4=33 which is hot.
and so on.

At the very least, it verified that D was the first letter alphabetically.  I did not verify that all the letters in "PONDER THIS" are used, but that is not necessary.

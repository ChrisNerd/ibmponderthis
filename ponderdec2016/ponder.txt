Here's an N=27 solution:
- ABCDEFGHI WXY Z ; JKLMNOPQ RSTUV
- ABCDEFGHI Z 0 ; JKLMNOPQ WXY
- ABCDEFGHI ; RSTUV WXY Z
- JKLMNOPQ Z ; RSTUV WXY 0

A = ABCDEFGHI
W = WXY
Z = Z
J = JKLMNOPQ
R = RSTUV
0 = 0

A = R + W + Z (1)
A + W + Z = J + R (2)
A + Z + 0 = J + W (3)
J + Z = R + W + 0 (4)

A - R - W - Z         (1)
A - R + W + Z     - J (2)
A     - W + Z + 0 - J (3)
  - R - W + Z - 0 + J (4)

9,5,3,1,1,8

1 -1 -1 -1  0  0 (1)
1 -1  1  1  0 -1 (2)
1  0 -1  1  1 -1 (3)
0 -1 -1  1 -1  1 (4)

c = [[1 -1 -1 -1  0  0],
[1 -1  1  1  0 -1],
[1  0 -1  1  1 -1],
[0 -1 -1  1 -1  1]]

8*rref (c)
ans =

    8    0    0    0    8  -10
    0    8    0    0    8   -6
    0    0    8    0    0   -3
    0    0    0    8    0   -1
    
1 3 6 10 are triangular numbers

Combine 1 and 2
R + W + Z + W + Z = J + R
2W + 2Z = J (2a)

Combine 2a and 3
2W + 2Z = J (2a)
A + Z + 0 = J + W (3)
A + Z + 0 = 2W + 2Z + W
A + 0 = 3W
R + W + Z + 0 = 3W
R + Z + 0 = 2W 






An N=30 solution:
- ABCD EFGHI JKLMNO ; PQRSTUV WXYZ0123
- ABCD PQRSTUV ; EFGHI JKLMNO
- JKLMNO PQRSTUV ; EFGHI WXYZ0123
- ABCD WXYZ0123 ; EFGHI PQRSTUV

To verify that the last solution works, you need to show that the only non-zero integer solution for the following equation set

    ( 1  1  1 -1 -1 ) (x4)   (0)
    ( 1 -1 -1  1  0 ) (x5)   (0)
    ( 0 -1  1  1 -1 ) (x6) = (0)
    ( 1 -1  0 -1  1 ) (x7)   (0)
                      (x8)
    

is (4,5,6,7,8), which means that all the participants are from the same gender as required.

An N=114 solution for five rope-pulling contests can be achieved by

     1 -1 -1  1 -1  1
    -1  1  0  1 -1  0
     1  1  0 -1 -1  1
     1  0  1  1 -1 -1
     1  1 -1  0  1 -1
    


with the only integer solution as follows:
9 12 20 22 25 26

You're logic is sound Jay, but you're totally going down the path of
the counterfeit coins problem,
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_puzzle
which is suuuuuper similar to this, but it involves identifying the
odd one out. This tug of war problem involves only *detecting* if
there's an odd one out, so that relaxes the problem enough to allow
this 4 game tournament to  be sufficient. The analogy is so close to
codes, where there are error correcting codes and error detecting
codes, where the error detecting codes get to be more efficient.

But yeah, your solution would totally work but I think the number of
matches you'd have to set up would be 14.

A v B (9v9)
A v C (9v9)

A1 v A2 (3v3)
A1 v A3 (3v3)
A1.1 v A1.2 (1v1)
A1.1 v A1.3 (1v1)

B1 v B2 (3v3)
B1 v B3 (3v3)
B1.1 v B1.2 (1v1)
B1.1 v B1.3 (1v1)

C1 v C2 (3v3)
C1 v C3 (3v3)
C1.1 v C1.2 (1v1)
C1.1 v C1.3 (1v1)

If you look at the problem, they even try to start you down that path,
solving for the case N=16 with just 4 matches.
https://www.research.ibm.com/haifa/ponderthis/challenges/December2016.html
A ; B
A B ; C D
A B C D ; E F G H
A B C D E F G H ; I J K L M N O P

Both this solution and your 3v3 solution are "nice" mathematically.
Unfortunately the actual solution of
- ABCDEFGHI WXY Z ; JKLMNOPQ RSTUV
- ABCDEFGHI Z 0 ; JKLMNOPQ WXY
- ABCDEFGHI ; RSTUV WXY Z
- JKLMNOPQ Z ; RSTUV WXY 0

is butt-ugly, only a computer can find that it seems to me.

Was 114 the largest solution that anyone submitted, or is there something magical about 114 that makes it the largest solution. If so I'm sure there's an entry on the online encyclopedia of integer sequences that goes something like 2, b,c, 114, is the maximum N you can solve this problem for given i tug of war games.

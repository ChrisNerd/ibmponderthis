(-100,0),(100,0),(0,300),(-399,384),(-51,934),(-1233,377),(31,1953),(-163,-1745),(2916,66)
which has an area of 7701668.

My approach to this problem was based on the assumption that each
point would be as far from the mean of the previous points as
possible, to maximize the increase in standard deviation for the next
points.  That means that each point should lie on a circle centred at
the previous points' mean, and has a radius 3 sigma.  This allows each
point to be defined by the angle from the centre, which is a single
number instead of two.  So only 7 dimensions to optimize over.

I wrote a simple loop in Octave where each iteration of the loop looks
through 100 possible angles for each of the 7 points then updates the
point which had the biggest increase in the convex hull area.  Each
angle is initialized randomly, and it turns out that this approach
often reaches its local maxima before the 7700000 criteria.  But it
found an adequate solution on only its second run so I didn't bother
with a more robust optimization technique.  I was all excited to try
Particle Swarm Optimization, and if I was competitive I'd try to get
that asterisk next to my name.

Thanks for the puzzle

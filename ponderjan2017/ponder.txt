Short answer:
x=(3126/3125)^3126, where the last 10 digits are 2137165824, the last
8 digits are distinct and do not contain 0 and 9. The first 10 digits
of x are 2.718716741 which differs from e from the 5th digit on.

The corresponding y value is y=(3126/3125)^3125, which has the first
10 digits 2.717847030 and the last 10 digits 6359186432.


Long answer:
There are no solutions to the bonus question (no 0 or 9 in the last 8
digits) for x when x<y. An infinite number of solutions for y are
shown in the attached pdf.

That was a tricky problem to solve completely. I was looking for
solutions only in x, where x<y and proved there are none, so I assumed
that's how people got the * for solving it.

Rational Solutions to x^y = y^x

In integers the equation xy=yx, where x and y are supposed to be distinct, has a unique solution (2, 4). (This is of course assuming that swapping x and y does give a new solution.

The situation is quite different if we are looking for rational solutions.

Let k=yx , then also y=kx. Putting this into xy=yx gives
	

xkx=(kx)x or (xk)x=(kx)x,

implying
	

xk=kx, or xk−1=k,

from which we get a general solution:
	

x=k1k−1, y=kk1k−1=kkk−1.

From y=kx it follows that if k is irrational then so will be either x or y. So, in order to have them both rational, we have to assume k rational as well. Let qp=1k−1 be in lowest terms. Then
	

k−1=pq, k=pp+q, kk−1=qp+q

so that
	

x=pp+qpq , y=pp+q(p+q)q 

Since qp is in lowest terms, p and q are mutually prime. and so are p and p+q. In order that both x and y be rational, it is necessary that both p and p+q be q-th powers of natural numbers. However, p=n^q, with q>=2, leads to
	

n^q < p+q < (1+n)^q= n^q+q*n^(q−1)+...

****which is only possible when q=1

****
WHAT? No it's not. It's totally fine when q>=2 as well.
Let q=2, n=3
p=n^q=3^2=9
p+q=9+2=11
(1+n)^q=4^2=16
So 9 < 11 < 16. Everythings fine!

Oooooh, I see. p+q must also be a square! 11 is not a square. It's saying that if p is a square (9), then the next square is 16, but p+q is less than 16, and therefore p+q is not a square.

So, to reiterate. Assuming p is a q-th power of n, p=n^q. That eventually implies that p+q can not also be a q-th power of a higher base.




. It follows that all positive rational solutions of the equation xy=yx are given by

(*)
	

x=((p+1)/p)^p  and y=((p+1)/p)^(p+1) ,

where p is an arbitrary integer, except 0 and −1.

The behavior of the solutions as p, is determined by the well known limit
	

limppp+1p=limp1+p1p=e

What if we let p=2^n???


x=((p+1)/p)^p  and y=((p+1)/p)^(p+1) ,

x=((2^n+1)/2^n)^(2^n)  and y=((2^n+1)/2^n)^(2^n+1)

In binary it's simple
x = 100000...001/10000...000 ^ 1000000...000
the division is simply a shift
1.00000...1 ^ 1000..000
Now we can use the binomial theorem?
(1+1/2^n)^(2^n)=1+2^n*n^(2^n-1)+...?
(1+1/2^n)^(2^n)=1+2^n*n^(2^n-1)+...?
(1+x)^n = (n 0) x^0 + (n 1) x^1 + (n 2) x^2 + ... + (n n-1)x^(n-1) + (n n) x^n

x->2^-n
n->2^n
(1+2^-n)^(2^n)=(2^n 0) 2^-n^0 + (2^n 1) 2^-n^1 + (2^n 2) 2^-n^2 + ... + (2^n 2^n-1)2^-n^(2^n-1) + (2^n 2^n) 2^-n^2^n

(2^n 0) 2^-n^0 = 1
(2^n 1) 2^-n^1 = 1
(2^n 2) 2^-n^2 = 2^n * (2^n - 1) /2 * 2^-2n = 2^(-n-1) * (2^n -1) = 2^-1 - 2^(-n-1) correct
(2^n 3) 2^-n^3 = 2^n * (2^n - 1) (2^n - 1) /6 * 2^-3n =
= 2^-2n * (2^n - 1) (2^n - 1) /6
+ ... +

(2^n 2^n-1)2^-n^(2^n-1) = 2^n


+ (2^n 2^n) 2^-n^2^n = 1 * 2^(-n*2^n) // bit shifted by n*2^n


jeez, we might as well as used it right off.

Or even better, let p=10^n, then the conversion to decimal is trivial.
Nope, the last digits look like ...00001

Almost got it with n=3, (1+1/5^n)^(5^n)
2.7074878332103145289643190668293393667162604447121572997248000490319739837522608339870968132678581810886455714471965136527077498487065318286459042758955401969093837328466127533332930527714803241917803896836488431899860808672933783040522630009687235367062080312482948631799680571391316162866476865756570918560214679508599976788897045845608568939340295733767070991324261 ends with 57293568

So x will only have "last digits" if p is of the form 2^pi*5^pj.
